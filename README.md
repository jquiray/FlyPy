### Aircraft sizing tool
For now basic aircraft sizing is available
- generally piston airplanes with options for jet (although without SL equivalent)
- no save/load function
- values inside are from Gudmundsson GA Aircraft Design Example 3-1 (converted from his imperial units)
- atmosphere model is based on freely available US Standard Atmosphere 1976
